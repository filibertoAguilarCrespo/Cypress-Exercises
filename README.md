Hi, the tests are in the cypress folder and in the e2e folder, in the testCart.cy.js test I put together the test to verify if the cart works and the bonus test, at the end I do a validation of the popup window.
In testP.cy.js I did the log in test with its "Welcome user" assertion, the user I used for the test is "fili@gmail.com" and its password is "123"
